    "text": "The Porsche 911 (pronounced Nine Eleven or in German: Neunelfer) is a two-door, 2+2 high performance rear-engined classic German sports car made since 1963[1] by Porsche AG of Stuttgart, Germany. It has a rear-mounted six cylinder boxer engine and all round independent suspension. It has undergone continuous development, though the basic concept has remained unchanged.[2] The engines were air-cooled until the introduction of the Type 996 in 1998, with Porsche's '993' series, produced in model years 1994â€“1998, being the last of the air-cooled Porsches.",
